Greater energy and stamina are just two benefits of MMT
It does this by shifting your metabolism from burning glucose as your primary fuel to burning fat instead.

When you replace carbs with fat for fuel, potentially: 
 	You optimize your mitochondrial function<br>
	You turn on your body’s ability to burn body fat<br>
	Your metabolism runs more efficiently<br>
	You enjoy long-lasting energy and stamina<br>
	Your brain functions more efficiently and you feel sharper mentally
Glucose is a “dirty” fuel, while fat burns much cleaner. So by replacing carbs with healthy fats, your cells’ mitochondria are less likely to suffer damage from free radicals that are caused by reactive oxygen species or ROS.

Since 90 percent or more of the total ROS in your body are produced within your mitochondria, these fragile components of your cells are continually under siege when there are excessive ROS. Some are needed for crucial cellular functions, but too many cause devastating damage. 

Previously, it was thought excessive ROS could be addressed by taking antioxidants, but we now know that this was a flawed strategy and it is far better to prevent their production by eating an optimal fuel mixture. 

MMT can help your cells’ mitochondria reach the “Goldilocks” zone for producing ROS — not too much and not too little, but just the “right” amounts for healthy cellular and mitochondrial function.
Why You Need Mitochondrial Metabolic Therapy (MMT)
What many people may not realize is that switching over to fat-burning is not an instantaneous “aha” moment. Nor is it a one-size-fits-all plan. 

That may be why, if you’ve ever tried a ketogenic diet, you weren’t able to reach or remain in ketosis long enough to produce significant health effects. 

My MMT program is a highly customizable, multi-step process that can take a few days or as long as a few months to become fully fat-adapted. Everyone is different.

Fat for Fuel walks you through the complete step-by-step process. You learn which foods and practices work best for you. 

My goal is to help you get there smoothly and as easily as possible, identifying and removing potential challenges ahead of time that can derail you off course.

						  Today, if you live in California128 or another state that has eliminated conscientious and religious belief vaccine exemptions and you refuse a government endorsed vaccine, you cannot get a school education, medical care or be employed as a child or health care worker unless you can find a doctor to write a medical exemption that 99.99 percent of Americans do not qualify for under CDC guidelines.129,130,131
And tomorrow? If Americans do not get off their knees and stop worshipping doctors promoting junk science, tomorrow you will not be able to get on a bus, train or plane; enter a store or sports arena; obtain a driver's license, file your taxes or function in society unless you can prove you have gotten every vaccine that industry creates and doctors implementing government policy order you to get.
And if you or your child get vaccinated, suffer brain inflammation and never recover your health, you can be sure that it will either be dismissed as a coincidence, or you will be labeled genetically defective with the claim you would have become brain damaged even if no vaccines had been given.132 It is already being done and it is so easy to do, when nobody making, selling, licensing, giving and voting to mandate vaccines has any accountability in a civil court of law.
And the ones who know deep in the core of their being that their children are in danger are the mothers, who carry their babies inside them for nine months and give birth, and are endowed with a primal instinct that gives them the courage to protect their babies from harm until they are able to survive on their own.
That biological imperative is hard-wired into our DNA because it is what protects the survival of every species on this earth.133,134,135,136And yet, mothers, who know their children best, are being bullied, ridiculed and punished if they use their intellect and listen to their gut instincts and refuse to violate their conscience when caring for their children.137
It is time to reject the cruel pseudo-ethic of utilitarianism propping up mandatory vaccination laws that justify child sacrifice by reducing what is moral to a mathematical equation.138
When the state considers one of us to be expendable, then we are all considered expendable. And if the state can tag, track down and force individuals to be injected with biologicals of known and unknown toxicity today, then there will be no limit on which individual freedoms the state can take away in the name of the greater good tomorrow.
We can only throw off the chemical chains making us sick if we act to instill truth, integrity and compassion in government and defend freedom of thought, speech, conscience and informed consent to medical risk taking. There is no greater calling for Americans in the 21st century than to defend those cultural values and human rights that protect against tyranny.
We will not be silent. We will not go away. We are the daughters and sons of liberty, and our mission continues: No forced vaccination. Not in America.

		                       <p>If you’re looking for the best strategy to dramatically improve your health, then you’ve come to the right place.
Many people today struggle with weight issues, diseases, and other health problems that impair their ability to enjoy life. Many resort to pharmaceutical drugs and other conventional methods to relieve their symptoms, but these are actually just Band-Aid solutions that typically result in more harm than good.
What they don’t realize is that they can significantly improve their health by just changing their diet and eating habits. And this program will help you achieve exactly that.
