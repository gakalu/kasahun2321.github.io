					As you age, your body produces fewer mitochondria, so that makes taking care of the ones you have all the more important.

When a significant percentage of your mitochondria stops functioning properly, your health can falter and leave you more vulnerable to cancer and other chronic diseases. 

However, we now know there are powerful strategies that can repair and improve the health of your mitochondria.<br>

What I believe to be the most valuable strategy for repairing your mitochondria is the main subject of my newest book:
Fat for Fuel: A Revolutionary Diet to Combat Cancer, Boost Brain Power, and Increase Your Energy.

You see, everything you eat affects your mitochondria – positively or negatively. 

When you make food choices that boost your mitochondrial health, you reduce the risk of damage to your cells’ genetic material or DNA that can lead to disease or cancer.
This Nutrition Plan is divided into Level 1 and 2. Level 1 is for beginners, such as those<br> who are new to this website and are not yet fully familiar with my health recommendations.<br>
However, if you are already implementing most of my health advice, then you can proceed to Level 2.<br> This is also recommended for people with serious medical conditions who are looking for extensive measures to promote healing and health.<br>
So how will you know if you’re ready to move on from Level 1 to Level 2? It’s simple: use these three health indicators.<br> Once they are in their optimal ranges, you will feel comfortable and confident enough to move on to the next level.<br>

                              This Optimized Healthy Food Pyramid Will Turn Your Health Around
The original food pyramid created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) promotes a diet that has grains, pasta, and bread at its base (meaning they make up the majority of your diet) and fats at the top, or the smallest portion. But this can spell trouble, as grains break down into sugar in your body, driving insulin and leptin resistance.
I strongly believe that for optimal health, you should follow the opposite: increase your intake of healthy saturated fats and limit your grain and sugar intake. I’ve created my own Food Pyramid based on this ratio.
 
I also believe that you should always be conscious of what you eat – this means avoiding all processed foods that are loaded with additives, harmful chemicals, and genetically engineered ingredients that could put your health at risk.
Fact: High-Quality Fat Is One of the Most Important Nutrients for You
Conventional physicians, nutritionists, and public health experts have long claimed that dietary fat promotes heart disease and obesity. This deception caused people to follow conventional low-fat, high-carb diets, which ruined the health of millions. Today, the general guideline for dietary fat intake is that it should only be 10 percent of your overall diet.
I believe that this is one of the most destructive health recommendations that have pervaded the U.S. food system, because you need at least 50 to 75 percent of your daily calorie intake in the form of healthy fats. This is one of the basic principles that I have incorporated in my Nutritional Plan.

Many people today struggle with weight issues, diseases, and other health problems that impair their ability to enjoy life. Many resort to pharmaceutical drugs and other conventional methods to relieve their symptoms, but these are actually just Band-Aid solutions that typically result in more harm than good.
What they don’t realize is that they can significantly improve their health by just changing their diet and eating habits. And this program will help you achieve exactly that.
